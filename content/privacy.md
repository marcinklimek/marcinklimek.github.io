## Who am I?

Ah, welcome, welcome! Step right through the digital-looking glass of https://klimek.link/, a whimsical domain curated by yours truly, the esteemed (and perhaps a bit eccentric) digital explorer and grand curator of the internet's vast oddities and marvels. This isn't your run-of-the-mill web abode, oh no! It's a labyrinthine archive of my boundless fascinations, an eclectic trove of digital breadcrumbs leading to the most curious corners of the webiverse.

Now, you might be pondering, "What, pray tell, is the purpose of this online sanctuary?" Ah, my dear virtual voyagers, this website is not peddling wares or vying for the fleeting glances of the masses. No, it stands as a beacon of personal indulgence, a digital expression of my very soul! Imagine, if you will, a cabinet of curiosities, but instead of moth-eaten taxidermy and dusty gemstones, it's brimming with hyperlinks. Each click is a portal to realms untold, each link a testament to human creativity and, occasionally, the absurd.

Amongst these curated marvels, you'll find passions as varied as the colours of the rainbow: art that dazzles the eyes, technology that boggles the mind, science that unveils the universe's secrets, and literature that transports the soul. And then, there are the niche hobbies, the peculiar obsessions that I hold dear—esoteric realms that might tickle your fancy or leave you pondering, "What on earth was he thinking?"

But wait, there's more! Lest you think this website is merely a static collection of digital delights, let me disabuse you of that notion posthaste. Beyond the hyperlinks lies a cornucopia of personal musings and blog posts where I wax poetic on the whys and wherefores of my diverse interests. You might stumble upon snapshots from my adventures, creative writings from the depths of my imagination, or projects that have ensnared my attention and, subsequently, my time.

Consider https://klimek.link/ not just a website but a voyage across the digital seas, with me as your captain, navigating through the mists of the internet to chart a course to the treasures I've found. It's an invitation to peer over my shoulder, to delve into the archives of my digital odyssey, and perhaps, in the process, embark on a quest of your own.

In sum, https://klimek.link/ is a personal manifesto, a declaration of love for the infinite possibilities that the internet affords us, lonely travellers. It's a patchwork quilt of my digital escapades, stitched together with links and lore, offered up to the world not in search of accolades but in the hope that you, dear visitor, might find a spark of curiosity, a moment of joy, or a new obsession to call your own. So, don your explorer's hat, and let the adventure begin!

## The Privacy Scroll: A Tale of Whimsy and Woe in the Land of Non-Data Questing

### Comments, or The Quest for the Enchanted Input

In the mystical realm of our website, a place teeming with jesters, knights, and perhaps the odd shrubbery, there lies a peculiar enchantment upon the art of commentary. Those brave souls seeking to inscribe their musings upon the tapestry of this digital Camelot must first embark upon a quest most curious. You see, in lieu of the mundane act of simply 'clicking to comment', one must instead summon forth the arcane energies of Extra Magical Power™. Aye, for here, the act of leaving one's mark amidst the scrolls of discussion requires not just any old sorcery but the mightiest of magics.

This departure from the mundane into the realm of the fantastical is by no design a mere happenstance but a carefully orchestrated enchantment to add layers of mystery and allure to our kingdom. It beckons the intrepid explorer to delve deeper into the lore of our lands, to truly become one with the narrative, and in doing so, discover the power within to leave their mark in the annals of our history.

### Media, or The Forbidden Archives

Venture forth into the saga of media uploads and behold a decree most prudent. Our dominion, rich in tales and treasures, guards its gates against the chaos of the unbidden content beast. The edict against the uploading of media artefacts stems not from a lack of chivalry but a fortress-like desire to protect the realm and its denizens from the dragons of copyright infringement, the trolls of offensiveness, and the spectres of misinformation.

In lieu of allowing the kingdom's coffers to be burdened by the weight of hosting countless scrolls and tapestries (for the bandwidth dragons are a greedy lot), we ensure that our realm remains swift, unburdened by the need to store these treasures. Instead, we foster a community where the exchange of ideas and the weaving of words create a tapestry more vibrant than any image or moving picture could convey.

### Contact Forms, or The Parchment Void

Ah, the saga of communication within our digital Camelot takes a twist most unconventional. In this land, the ancient and oft-maligned scroll of the Contact Form has been banished. "How then," you might ponder, "does one send missives to the keep?" Fear not, for our rejection of the parchment void is not a descent into madness but a bold stride into a realm where communication is unbound by the traditional chains.

We've foregone the silent whispers into the void in favour of more tangible connections, where your words are not lost to the ether but received with the warmth and regard they deserve. So, worry not about carrier pigeons or smoke signals; we are but an electronic missive or a herald's shout on social media away from the conversation.

### Cookies, or The Enchanted Crumbs

Gather round as I spin the tale of our kingdom's most diminutive and yet vital inhabitants: the enchanted crumbs known as Cookies. These tiny conjurers work in the shadows to smooth the path through our digital realm, ensuring your voyage is as seamless as a knight sliding down a bannister greased with the essence of jest.

Should these mystical assistants not be to your liking, fear not! For you wield the power to banish them, to disable their enchantments and traverse our lands unaided, should you so choose. The choice, brave traveller, is entirely yours.

### Embedded Content, or The Portals to Other Realms

Within the halls of our digital Camelot, we've opened portals to distant lands, bringing forth embedded treasures for your viewing pleasure. Beware, though, for these artefacts come with their own enchantments and watchers keen to learn of those who gaze upon them. Venture forth with joy, but let caution be your guide, lest you find yourself ensnared in their captivating spells.

### The Chronicles of Non-Data

In the vastness of our kingdom, where tales abound, and laughter fills the air, the collection of data is a tale untold. What need do we have for such quests when the journey itself is our reward? We collect nought but memories, leaving no trace behind but the echoes of joy and wonder.

### And So, The Tale Concludes

Thus ends our journey through the whimsy and wonders of our privacy practices, a realm where data is but a myth, and the only treasure is the joy of your visit. Venture forth with light hearts and laughter, for in this land, you are free to explore without burden or worry. Onward, brave adventurers, to the next chapter of your journey!
