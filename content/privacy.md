## Who am I?

I own the website https://klimek.link/. It is purely personal in nature, mainly a collection of links to something I'm interested in.

## What personal information do I collect, and why I don't collect it?

### Comments

Visitors to the site are not able to leave a comment.

### Media

Visitors to the site are not allowed to upload any media.

### Contact forms

There are no contact forms.

### Cookies

I do not collect any information about visitors. Cookies are used to improve site navigation. You can disable them through your browser settings.

### Embedded Content from Other Sites

Articles on this site may contain embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other sites behaves as if you were visiting the specific site directly.

These sites may collect information about you, use cookies, attach additional third-party tracking systems, and monitor your interactions with the embedded material, including if you have an account and are logged in to that site.

## Statistics

Basically, nothing is analyzed; it's a waste of time.

## To whom do I share data?

I don't share statistics with anyone because I don't have them.

## How long do I store your data?

I do not keep them because I do not collect them. So I don't.

## What rights do you have to your data?

If you have a user account (you don't have one because it's not possible to create one) or have posted comments on this site (it's not possible to post comments), you can request to receive a file with an exported set of your personal data in our possession, including all data provided by you. In that particular case, it will be an empty file, but you're the one who asked for it. You may also request that we delete all of your personal information in our "possession". This does not apply to any data I am obliged to retain for administrative, legal, or security reasons.

## Where do I send the data?

An automated spam detection service does not check visitor comments because they cannot be left. In general, I do not send data anywhere.

## Your contact information

I do not collect it.

## Additional information

### How do I protect your information?

Not collecting visitor information.

### What procedures do I have in place in the event of a data privacy breach?

Since visitor data is not collected, a breach of privacy can only involve the site owner and such an event will probably be reported to the appropriate authoritiesâ€”assuming it makes sense at all.
