# My project for a climbing wall. 

> Although in principle a climbing wall is not necessary.

The first recorded tests took place on March 11, 2016. A straightforward and reasonably practical solution. You can read a little more about the beginning of my project steps here: https://klimek.link/blog/processing-z-opencv/

The latest version is  Open Frameworks based solution. Activities are written in embedded scripting language - Lua. 

You can find project development on GitHub: [cinderclimb-of](https://github.com/marcinklimek/cinderclimb-of)
