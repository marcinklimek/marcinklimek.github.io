  Since a lot of people are asking for suggestions on songs, artists etc, here are my two (more) cents in a quick note. According to my personal taste, the third part of an atypical music trilogy' since all of them had similar emotional impact on me' that included “An analog Guy In A Digital World” and “Says” in the last few years, is Brian Reitzell’s “Bloodfest”, a revisited version of J.S. Bach’s Aria from the Goldberg Variations.  
  
  In a more neoclassical direction one can search for example for Jóhann Jóhannsson’s work (IBM 1401, a User's Manual Part I' IBM 1401 Processing Unit ) or among the artists of the label Erased Tapes (Lubomyr Melnyk for instance for the piano lovers) . Towards an electronic direction Gidge (I Fell In Love), could be a great recommendation worthy of the aforementioned songs.
  
  A suggestion to everyone who enjoys listening to Martin Roth's and Nils Frahm's songs (An Analog Guy In A Digital World and Says). Take a listen to The Antiphon (Epilogue) by Kasper Bjørke. From the album Kasper Bjørke Quartet: The Fifty Eleven Project (2018) released earlier this month (10/2018).
