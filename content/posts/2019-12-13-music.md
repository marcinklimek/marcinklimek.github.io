  * [12/18] Since a lot of people are asking for suggestions on songs, artists etc, here are my two (more) cents in a quick note. According to my personal taste, the third part of an atypical music trilogy &#8211; since all of them had similar emotional impact on me &#8211; that included “An analog Guy In A Digital World” and “Says” in the last few years, is Brian Reitzell’s “Bloodfest”, a revisited version of J.S. Bach’s Aria from the Goldberg Variations.  
    In a more neoclassical direction one can search for example for Jóhann Jóhannsson’s work (&#8220;IBM 1401, a User&#8217;s Manual Part I &#8211; IBM 1401 Processing Unit &#8220;) or among the artists of the label Erased Tapes (Lubomyr Melnyk for instance for the piano lovers) . Towards an electronic direction Gidge (&#8220;I Fell In Love&#8221;), could be a great recommendation worthy of the aforementioned songs.
  * [10/18] A suggestion to everyone who enjoys listening to Martin Roth&#8217;s and Nils Frahm&#8217;s songs (An Analog Guy In A Digital World and Says). Take a listen to &#8220;The Antiphon (Epilogue)&#8221; by Kasper Bjørke. From the album &#8220;Kasper Bjørke Quartet: The Fifty Eleven Project&#8221; (2018) released earlier this month (10/2018).
