  The database was performing poorly after a system upgrade, and disk I/O inflation (a massive increase in the number of I/O operations submitted) was suspected. There can be many causes for this: a worse cache-hit ratio, record-size inflation, readahead inflation, other applications, even other asynchronous kernel tasks (file system background scrubs). The question was: which one, and how do we fix it?
