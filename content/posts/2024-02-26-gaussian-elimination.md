[A visual explanation of Gaussian Elimination](https://injuly.in/blog/gaussian-elimination/index.html)


This post delves into the intuition behind Gaussian Elimination, a cornerstone algorithm in linear algebra for solving systems of equations. It revisits the algorithm through a simple 2D example, emphasizing matrix representation and permissible operations to simplify systems. The post uniquely visualizes the process, explaining how transformations parallel to coordinate axes help deduce solutions, extending the concept from 2D lines to 3D planes and N-dimensional hyperplanes. It also explores the method's application in higher dimensions, aiming to demystify the mathematical logic behind this widely used technique.
