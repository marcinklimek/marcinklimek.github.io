Repo for good papers to read.

<https://github.com/papers-we-love>

> What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with?  
> Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper (because of HARD MATH!).  
> We&#8217;re curating a <a style="display: inline; color: #2a9bc7; text-decoration: none;" href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">repository</a> for papers and places-to-find papers. You can contribute by adding PR&#8217;s for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories. We&#8217;re posting <a style="display: inline; color: #2a9bc7; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PapersWeLove">videos</a> of all our presentations, from all our chapters.
