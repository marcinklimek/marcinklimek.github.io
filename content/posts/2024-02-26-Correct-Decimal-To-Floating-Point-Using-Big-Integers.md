The "Exploring Binary" website covers a wide range of topics related to binary numbers, including their properties, arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and peculiarities like bicimals (binary decimals) and binary palindromes. It also delves into visualizations of binary numbers, conversions between decimal and floating-point binary numbers, and the mathematical foundations underlying these conversions. Additionally, the site explores the length of numbers in decimal versus binary formats and features articles on correctly rounding during conversions. This comprehensive resource serves as a detailed guide to understanding and working with binary numbers in various computational contexts.
